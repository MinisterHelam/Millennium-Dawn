- Inflation now distinguishes nation-specific healthy GDP-per-capita growth from bounded overheating, with normalized economic cycles, neutral-rate monetary policy, and pressure from money printing, currency depreciation, unsustainable deficits, and unanchored expectations; currency effects now refresh immediately after monetary actions and reserve changes, while weaker depreciation feedback prevents extreme inflation spikes.

- Financial collapses now restructure unsustainable debt and avoid recurring AI coups, weak-currency spirals, and repeat collapses; AI now prepares for event-driven wars and penalizes reserve currencies issued by active exploiters
- Currencies no longer drift to 0.15 or 2.0: each settles around its historical strength, moved by the real policy rate, the risk premium on its debt, inflation above 5%, stability, the economic cycle, wars, sanctions and financial collapses, with years of good or bad management shifting where it settles. Reserve issuers gain from countries using their currency and the AI no longer abandons its own, faction ties only pull toward a currency whose issuer leads that faction, the dollar, yen and franc gain slightly during long periods of high world tension, and issuer drift limits now apply. The AI keeps its policy rate above inflation, expands the money supply only when its currency has room, uses austerity in inflation crises, and smaller economies raise taxes and trim spending as deficits grow relative to income instead of borrowing until interest traps them

- [UKR] Added +1 airbase level in Lviv (700) and Khmelnytskyi (1240) to better recreate actual capacity in those regions
